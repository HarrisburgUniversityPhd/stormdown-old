# The First Appendix

This first appendix includes all of the R chunks of code that were hidden throughout the document (using the `include = FALSE` chunk tag) to help with readibility and/or setup.

**In the main Rmd file**

```{r ref.label='include_packages', results='hide', echo = TRUE}
```

**In Chapter \@ref(ref-labels):**

```{r ref.label='include_packages_2', results='hide', echo = TRUE}
```
