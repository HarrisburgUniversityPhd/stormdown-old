# Introduction {#introduction}

Explain your work as a whole.

<!--
You need at least three works to make up a portfolio.
You may add more, but the numbering scheme is limited to five before you need to re-aligh the whole thing.

The rest of the dissertation portfolio is outlined as follows.
A review of the overall lititure is presented in Chapter \@ref(literature-review).
Three personal works are then presented following the normal layout.

* Title of work A. Chapter \@ref(a-title) Sections \@ref(a-introduction) through \@ref(a-conclusion)
* Title of work B. Chapter \@ref(b-title) Sections \@ref(b-introduction) through \@ref(b-conclusion)
* Title of work C. Chapter \@ref(c-title) Sections \@ref(c-introduction) through \@ref(c-conclusion)

Chapter \@ref(conclusion) concludes the dissertation portfolio and provides insights to how the three works fit together as a cohesive whole.
