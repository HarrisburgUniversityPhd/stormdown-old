### R chunks {#a-r-chunks}

When you click the **Knit** button above a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document.
You can embed an **R** code chunk like this (`cars` is a built-in **R** dataset):

```{r a-cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Inline code

If you'd like to put the results of your analysis directly into your discussion, add inline code like this:

> The `cos` of $2 \pi$ is `r cos(2*pi)`. 

Another example would be the direct calculation of the standard deviation:

> The standard deviation of `speed` in `cars` is `r sd(cars$speed)`.

One last neat feature is the use of the `ifelse` conditional statement which can be used to output text depending on the result of an **R** calculation:

> `r ifelse(sd(cars$speed) < 6, "The standard deviation is less than 6.", "The standard deviation is equal to or greater than 6.")`

Note the use of `>` here, which signifies a quotation environment that will be indented.

As you see with `$2 \pi$` above, mathematics can be added by surrounding the mathematical text with dollar signs.
More examples of this are in [Mathematics and Science] if you uncomment the code in [Math].
