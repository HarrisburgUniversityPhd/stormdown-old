### Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics.
Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.
One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

Be _very_ careful with your formulas.
\TeX\ is heavly dependent on symboles and will give unhelpful errors when doing a final knit.
Just because it renders up real nicely in RStudio does not mean it will compile to PDF.
"Undefined control sequence" and "" are good examples of \TeX\ going ary.

$$
\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq \frac{\beta_i^2}{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2} \left[ 2\rho_i^2 + \frac{\delta_i^2\beta_i^2}{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
