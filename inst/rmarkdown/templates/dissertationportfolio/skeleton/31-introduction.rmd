## Introduction {#b-introduction}

<!--  If you're still on the fence about using _R Markdown_, check out the resource for newbies available at <https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/> .  -->

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.
Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs.
In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.
Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.
You'll see more on this later.
