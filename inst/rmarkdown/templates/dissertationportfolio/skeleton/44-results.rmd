### Footnotes and Endnotes

You might want to footnote something.
^[footnote text] The footnote will be in a smaller font and placed appropriately.
Endnotes work in much the same way. 

### Cross-referencing chapters and sections 

The [bookdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/cross-references.html) is an excellent source for learning how to cross-reference in a bookdown project such as a stormdown document.
Here we only cover the most common uses for a typical dissertation.
If you want something more complex or fancy, please refer to the bookdown documentation and seek help from the developers of that package. 

By default, all of your chapter and section headers will get an auto-generated ID label For example, e.g., `# Chapter 1` will have an auto-generated ID `chapter-1`.
Note that the ID label is all lower case, and has no spaces.
If you have any kind of punctuation in your header, such as a colon (:), it will not appear in the ID label.
Then in your text you can reference chapter one in your Rmd file like this: 'as discussed in Chapter `\@ref(chapter-1)`', which will print as 'as discussed in Chapter 1'

We strongly recommend that you to manually assign ID labels to your chapter header to make it easy to cross-reference.

### Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels {#ref-labels}

`### Tables, Graphics, References, and Labels {#ref-labels}`

The `{#ref-labels}` part of this header is the ID label.
It doesn't show in the output, but is there for us to use for easy cross-referencing, because it can be short, and we don't need to change it elsewhere our document when we update the chapter header.
We can use this custom ID label in our Rmd document like this: 'as discussed in Chapter `\@ref(ref-labels)`', which will print as 'as discussed in Chapter \@ref(ref-labels)'.
If you need to show custom text instead of the chapter number, you use this syntax in your Rmd document: `see [my chapter about labels](#ref-labels) for more details` which will appear as 'see [my chapter about labels](#ref-labels) for more details'

To cross-reference a specific section in the same chapter, we recommend adding a custom ID label to the section header, and using that to cross-reference.
For example, earlier in this chapter we have a section on tables and in the Rmd file we see `## Tables {#tables}`.
We can cross-reference that in the text like this 'as discussed in the section on `[tables](#tables)`' which will appear as 'as discussed in the above section on [tables](#tables)'

To cross-reference a section in a different chapter we can use the ID label from that section directly.
For example, we can write in our Rmd document `as discussed in the section on [R code chunks](#a-r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(literature-review)` which will appear as 'as discussed in the section on [R code chunks](#a-r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(literature-review)'. 

If you prefer to cross-reference by the section number, we can use custom ID labels in our Rmd document.
For example, to refer to a section in our first chapter, we can write in the Rmd document: `as discussed in section \@ref(a-r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(literature-review)`.
This will appear with section and chapter numbers like so: as 'as discussed in section \@ref(a-r-chunks) in Chapter \@ref(literature-review)'. 

### Bibliographies

Of course you will need to cite things, and you will probably accumulate an armful of sources.
There are a variety of tools available for creating a bibliography database (stored with the .bib extension).
In addition to BibTeX suggested below, you may want to consider using the free and easy-to-use tool called Zotero.
Some Zotero documentation is at <http://libguides.reed.edu/citation/zotero>.
In addition, a tutorial is available from Middlebury College at <http://sites.middlebury.edu/zoteromiddlebury/>.

_R Markdown_ uses _pandoc_ (<http://pandoc.org/>) to build its bibliographies.
One nice caveat of this is that you won't have to do a second compile to load in references as standard LaTeX requires.
To cite references in your dissertation (after creating your bibliography database), place the reference name inside square brackets and precede it by the "at" symbol.
For example, here's a reference to a book about worrying:  [@molina1994].
This `molina1994` entry appears in a file called `_refrences.bib`.
This bibliography database file was created by a program called BibTeX.
You can call this file something else if you like (look at the YAML header in the index.Rmd file) and, by default, is to placed in the root.  

For more information about BibTeX and bibliographies, see (<http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/index.html>)^[@reedweb2007].
There are three pages on this topic: _bibtex_ (which talks about using BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtex.html>), _bibtexstyles_ (about how to find and use the bibliography style that best suits your needs, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html>) and _bibman_ (which covers how to make and maintain a bibliography by hand, without BibTeX, at <http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibman.html>).
The last page will not be useful unless you have only a few sources.

**Tips for Bibliographies**

- Like with dissertation formatting, the sooner you start compiling your bibliography for something as large as dissertation, the better. 
- The cite key (a citation's label) needs to be unique from the other entries.
- When you have more than one author or editor, you need to separate each author's name by the word "and" e.g. `Author = {Noble, Sam and Youngberg, Jessica},`.
- Bibliographies made using BibTeX (whether manually or using a manager) accept LaTeX markup, so you can italicize and add symbols as necessary.
- To force capitalization in an article title or where all lowercase is generally used, bracket the capital letter in curly braces.

We love to see people using _R Markdown_ for their issertations, and are happy to help.
